============

Tropo Client is a simple jQuery plugin and JavaScript library that turns any web browser into a phone; capable of making phone calls and sending instant messages. 

The Tropo Client SDK provides an object-oriented JavaScript API for embedding two-way audio and chat onto any web page. The Tropo Client SDK is a pure client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on your part; all communication is handled transparently by the Developer Garden Cloud.
